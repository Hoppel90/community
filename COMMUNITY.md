# The Flux Community Team

The wider Flux community identified work that falls into the categories of contributor experience, advocacy and communications, community management as integral to its success long ago. While this has been an implicit focus of the team for a while, we want to build out the team, open it up and formalise processes.

## Responsibilities

As opposed to defining a big overarching burden of responsibilities the team would have a hard time to actually realise, we want to slowly and carefully add tasks as we build out the team.

- **Project communications** the process for this needs to be formalised still, but we would like to provide a simple and scalable process for all Flux sub-projects to report their progress to the world. Currently on our agenda are:
  - Monthly blog post
  - Social media
  - Mailing list
  - Slack
- Oversight of [this repository](https://github.com/fluxcd/community).
